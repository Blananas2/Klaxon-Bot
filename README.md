# Klaxon-Bot
## v1.1
Sounds an alarm when someone says the chosen word.

Use [tinyurl.com/klaxonbot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1281154203091337268&permissions=274878417984&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands) to invite the bot to your server. The default word is 'klaxon'. Use k!help for commands.

To test for PRs or personal use, go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application with SERVER MEMBERS INTENT and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT enabled in the Bot settings. Create a config.json and add the token from this application to it. Then, run klxn.py after installing the dependancies at the top (install moviepy V1.0.3 using pip install moviepy==1.0.3 if you're having trouble with moviepy.editor).
