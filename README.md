# Klaxon-Bot
Sounds an alarm when someone says the chosen word.

Use tinyurl.com/klaxonbot (https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1281154203091337268&permissions=274878417984&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands) to invite the bot to your server. The default word is 'klaxon'.

To test for PRs or personal use, go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Create a config.json and add the token from this application to it. Then, run klxn.py after installing the dependancies at the top.
